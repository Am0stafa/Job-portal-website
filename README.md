 ** Project Overview
The internships portal is one initiative being launched by the GIU career office. The aim is to provide a
unique gateway for motivated high-performing GIU students, to access exclusive, high-quality internship
opportunities being offered by local and international employers. Students will get the opportunity to
register, search and apply for internships based on their majors. Also, employers will be able to register
and post job ads to find the suitable applicants.
The internships will offer excellent opportunities for our students to learn new skills, gain experience with
the most prestigious employers, and build valuable business relationships.
